With the mass scale adoption of renewable energy sources the power grid is undergoing significant changes. Microgrids, powered by hybrid energy sources are seen as the future of the power grid due to their resilience and local operation. To maximize the energy yield we need to operate the hybrid energy sources at the maximum power point. Maximum energy yield signifies optimum utilization of the available energy and thus cheaper electricity costs, high scalability and high incentives to switch to renewable energy sources. Maximum power point tracking techniques have been used to track the maximum power point for photovoltaic system and wind energy conversion system. In modern times, with the rise of intelligent systems, the older maximum power point tracking algorithms can be updated to make them smarter and thus faster and more efficient. In this project we used machine learning to develop an artificial neural network powered perturb and observe algorithm and compared its performance with the conventional perturb and observe algorithm. We discuss the benefits and future scope of Machine Learning based. Maximum Power Point Tracking algorithms for hybrid energy sources.
