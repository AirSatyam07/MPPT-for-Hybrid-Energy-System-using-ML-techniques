With the widespread adoption of renewable energy sources, the power grid is undergoing significant transformations. Microgrids, powered by hybrid energy sources, are viewed as the future of the power grid due to their resilience and localized operation. To maximize energy yield, it's essential to operate hybrid energy sources at their maximum power point. Achieving maximum energy yield signifies optimal utilization of available energy, leading to cheaper electricity costs, high scalability, and greater incentives to switch to renewable energy sources.

Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques have been traditionally used to optimize the energy output of photovoltaic systems and wind energy conversion systems. In modern times, with the rise of intelligent systems, conventional MPPT algorithms can be enhanced to become smarter, faster, and more efficient. In this project, we developed an artificial neural network-powered perturb and observe algorithm using machine learning and compared its performance with the conventional perturb and observe algorithm. We discuss the benefits and future scope of machine learning-based MPPT algorithms for hybrid energy sources.

This summary highlights the advancements in MPPT techniques and the potential improvements brought by incorporating machine learning, offering a glimpse into the future of efficient energy management in hybrid microgrids.
